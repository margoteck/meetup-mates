## Welcome to Meetup Mates

Meetup Mates is a community run on slack for people who attend London tech meetups together. Our goal is to help gather and connect like-minded people who want to join the meetup space, but prefer to attend with someone they already are familiar with.

Meetup Mates is still a work in progress project, but we’re looking for 50 brave sailors to test the waters with us, so if you’re up for it share your details below. Yo Ho Ho!
